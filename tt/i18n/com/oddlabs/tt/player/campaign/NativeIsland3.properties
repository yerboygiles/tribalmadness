header6=Chief Ngumba
dialog6=Ehrm, sure. He taught me to control the weather so I could strike down my enemies with furious lightning. Somehow it doesn''t seem to work in this cold climate though.

header7=Thor
dialog7=Then he must also have taught you to make that delicious Stinking Stew he used to cook back in the good old days. I love exotic food, but my wife always serves the same boring minced pork and black pudding. Cook me some stew and I''ll help you out with your lightning problem!
