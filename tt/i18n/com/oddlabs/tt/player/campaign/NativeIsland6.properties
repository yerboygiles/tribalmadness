description=Maybe this is the secret island Grimhildur Guzzlegut talked about, when he said Fjorleif sailed westwards with the statues.

header0=Chief Ngumba
dialog0=Death & Diarrhoea, no statues here either! At least it seems like some of our own countrymen have set up a camp a bit further up the coast.

header1=Chief Gotoba
dialog1=Hail thee, Chief Ngumba! We are a group of former thralls who have escaped. Thanks to the sheer size of this island we managed to hide from the Vikings. We are setting up a camp here so we can build a ship and sail home.

header2=Chief Ngumba
dialog2=How about we team up and drive the Vikings off this island then? With no Vikings to interfere, I''m sure your boat-building business would be a lot easier.

header3=Chief Gotoba
dialog3=Sounds like a plan... time for some Viking-bashing!

header4=Ngolongo Nimblefeet
dialog4=Hey chief, we found an interesting map in the ruins. It shows an island we didn''t know about, so I have drawn it on our map now. Maybe that''s where Fjorleif is hiding?
