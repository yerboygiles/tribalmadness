dialog0=Oh my, what a disaster! Not only did we drink too much again, we were also hit by a raging thunderstorm that lasted for days. One can only wonder where we have ended up. Half of the crew is missing and Chief Fjorleif fell over board somewhere near this island. I think he is being held captive by the natives... we have to free him!

dialog1=Good work, men! While I was held captive by the natives, I managed to copy one of their maps. I think they''ve got some treasure hidden on the larger islands. We lost all our loot in the storm and I dare not imagine what our wives would do to us if we return empty-handed from this trip, so let''s get to work!

game_over=Chief Fjorleif was killed. Game over.
